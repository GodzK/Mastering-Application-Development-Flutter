# 🐦 Introduction to Flutter
Hello, I'm **Phakaphol Dherachaisuphakij (Pk)**  
A passionate **QA Specialist** and **Frontend Developer**  
Currently at **SCB TechX**, building robust testing pipelines  
Skilled in **React**, **Next.js**, and **Cypress**

This is my personal note on getting started with **Flutter**, a modern UI toolkit by Google that allows building natively compiled apps from a single codebase.

## 🔧 What is Flutter?

Flutter is an **open-source UI framework** developed by Google for building cross-platform apps — Android, iOS, Web, and even Desktop — using a single codebase written in **Dart**.

- Work across multiple platforms
- Have a **strong developer community**

## 🎯 Dart: The Language Behind Flutter

Flutter apps are written in **Dart**, a language that feels like a blend of JavaScript and Java.
